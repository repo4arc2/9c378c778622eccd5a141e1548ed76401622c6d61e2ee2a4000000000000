It's a prism of endless possibility.

14
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:10,850
一个选择便能开辟出无数个现实
Where a single choice can branch out into infinite realities,

15
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:16,280
创造出与你所知不同的平行世界

"假如"呢

22
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:51,010
布鲁斯·班纳博士  躲在浩克体内的人类
Dr. Bruce Banner, the human hiding within the Hulk,

23
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:54,540
从天而降  来警告人类有迫在眉睫的危险
fell from the stars to warn humanity of imminent danger.

24
00:01:55,210 --> 00:01:59,330
但他找到的世界并不是他所认识的那一个
But the world he found was not one he recognized.

25
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:07,640
灭霸要来了  他要来了
Thanos is coming. He's coming.

26
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,640
有人吗
Hello?

27
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,890
有人有衣服吗
Anyone got any clothes?

28
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:20,920
天呐
Oh, God.

29
00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:27,870
我来晚了吗
Was I too late?

30
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:34,160
老天
Ah, jeez.

31
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,960
大家伙  该变绿了
Come on, big guy, time to go green.

32
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:42,760
糟了
Oh, no.

33
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:44,930
听我说  你们应当开心
Hear me and rejoice.

34
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:47,500
出来啊  出来啊
Come out! Come out! Come out!

35
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,380
不要
No!

36
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:51,270
什么叫"不要"
What do you mean, "No"?

37
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:56,060
你即将死在我们手下  我们的父亲是...
You are about to die at the hands of the children of...

38
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:02,370
托尼  哈哈  你们死定了
Tony? Boy, are you guys screwed!

39
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:09,580
上啊  钢铁侠
Yeah, Iron Man!

40
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:16,860
等等  你们在...  那...
Wait, what are you guys... That's...

41
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:22,570
出手也太重了吧
Uh, that sorta seems like overkill.

42
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:38,510
这...
It's...

43
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:42,790
真不敢相信
I can't believe it.

44
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:52,070
不  不  不
No, no, no, no.

45
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:58,540
别吃我
Don't eat me!

46
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:14,860
糟了
Oh, no.

47
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:17,960
不不  别吃我  别吃我
No, no, no. Don't eat me. Don't eat me.

48
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:19,580
我...我吃素的
I'm... I'm vegan.

49
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:25,490
我的妈呀  又怎么了
Oh, holy crow. Oh, come on! What now?

50
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:29,400
天呐  太恶心了
Oh, God. Okay. This is disgusting.

51
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:41,380
不  我要吐了  我真的要吐了
Oh, no. Oh! I'm gonna vomit. I'm definitely gonna vomit.

52
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:43,100
快走  有它们在  你很安全
Go! You'll be safe with them.

53
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:45,880
这些巨型蚂蚁吗  你是谁
With the giant ants? Who are you?

54
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,370
仅剩的人类
All that's left.

55
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:51,320
-别吃我别吃我别吃我  -冷静点
- Don't eat me, don't eat me, don't eat... - Hey, relax.

56
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,730
我是友好邻居蜘蛛侠
I'm just your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man.

57
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:56,190
是吗  那这街区到底发生了什么
Oh, yeah? Well, then, what the hell happened to the neighborhood?

58
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:58,630
和众多重大灾难一样
Like too many great catastrophes,

59
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:02,640
这次灾难也起源于爱与希望之地
this one sprang from a place of love and hope.

60
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:08,790
两周前  汉克·皮姆博士进入了量子域
Two weeks earlier, Dr. Hank Pym journeyed into the quantum realm,

61
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:11,750
寻找他失踪已久的妻子
searching for his long-lost wife.

62
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:13,420
但在这个宇宙
But in this universe,

63
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:14,760
珍妮特·凡·戴恩感染了
Janet Van Dyne contracted

64
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:17,760
一种量子病毒  大脑被侵蚀
a quantum virus that corrupted her brain.

65
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,300
所以经过漫长的30年分别
So when she finally reunited

66
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:22,510
她终于和她丈夫重聚时
with her husband after 30 long years...

67
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:27,280
悲剧发生了
That happened.

68
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:35,670
霍普·凡·戴恩望穿秋水的家庭团聚并未如愿
Alas, Hope Van Dyne's long-awaited family reunion was not to be.

69
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:38,850
-妈妈  -你好  凡·戴恩女士
- Mom? - Hi, Miss Van Dyne.

70
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:44,850
我去  汉克  不
Holy... What the... Hank! No.

71
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:50,360
24小时之内
Within 24 hours,

72
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:53,560
整个太平洋西北地区都被感染了
the entire Pacific Northwest was infected.

73
00:05:55,670 --> 00:05:58,260
讽刺的是  正是复仇者的英勇行为
Ironically, it was the avengers' heroism

74
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:00,340
封死了人类的命运
that sealed humanity's fate.

75
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:01,900
听我号令
On my mark.

76
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:09,570
因为一旦地球最强英雄组合加入了被感染队伍
Because once earth's mightiest heroes joined the infected,

77
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,520
其他人都绝无生机
no one else stood a chance.

78
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:17,160
当然了  除非他们知道生存法则
Unless, of course, they knew the rules.

79
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:23,820
{\an8}丧尸末日生存法则

80
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:25,320
{\an8}大脑

81
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:28,390
纽约  大都会队所在地  克莱斯勒大厦
New York! Home of the Mets, the Chrysler Building,

82
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:29,840
《欲望都市》里那些姐姐
those ladies from Sex and the City,

83
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:33,170
现在又多了丧尸末日
and now, the zombie apocalypse!

84
00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:35,420
如果你能在这儿立足  你就可以在任何地方生存
If you can make it here, you can make it anywhere.

85
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:37,730
但首先  你不能被吃掉
But first, you have to not get eaten.

86
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,250
{\an8}我不是单身狗
我要把童子身献给雷神

87
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:42,510
{\an8}其实并不开心的哈皮·霍根
技能  驾驶  泡咖啡  拳击

88
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:42,270
{\an8}技能  驾驶  买咖啡  拳击

89
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:44,120
第一步  长袖衣服
Step one. Long sleeves.

90
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,110
我必须得穿这件吗
Do I have to be wearing this?

91
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:47,370
拜托了  世界的安全都靠这个了
Come on. The safety of the world depends on it.

92
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:48,500
开拍  上僵尸
And action, zombies!

93
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,440
我来了  坏僵尸
Here I come. Bad zombie.

94
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:54,860
{\an8}库尔特
怪胎市民

95
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:54,860
{\an8}库尔特  语言  斯拉夫民间传说  犯罪故事

96
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:57,020
僵尸病毒是通过唾液传播的
The zombie virus is passed through saliva.

97
00:06:57,020 --> 00:07:00,240
所以你暴露的皮肤越少  能被咬到的地方就越少
So the less skin you're showing, the less there is to bite.

98
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,880
第二步  个人卫生
Step two, hygiene.

99
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:04,330
僵尸会被人肉的气味吸引来
Zombies are attracted to the smell of human flesh.

100
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:07,010
所以尽量少释放信息素最好
So the less pheromones you give off, mmm, the better.

101
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:08,130
需要注意一点
But just one catch.

102
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:10,730
你脱光的时候是最脆弱的
You're never more vulnerable than in your birthday suit.

103
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:12,260
偷袭
The sneak attack!

104
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:15,570
{\an8}巴基·巴恩斯  沉默但致命

105
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:15,570
{\an8}技能  谋杀  金属臂  睡得沉

106
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:20,180
你的金属臂是防水的  真顺手啊  这是个双关
Your robot arm is waterproof. How handy! Pun intended.

107
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:21,810
你知道我只要一捏就能杀死你吧
You know all I have to do is squeeze, right?

108
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:23,340
好了  好了  放松点  杀手
Okay, okay. Easy, killer.

109
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:26,200
不如跳过洗澡这部分  直接展示身体喷雾吧
How about we skip the shower and grab the body spray?

110
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:27,730
不
No!

111
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:30,590
{\an8}莎伦·卡特  金发版波诺

112
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,590
{\an8}技能  间谍  急救  写悼词

113
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:31,530
好了  第三步
Okay, step three.

114
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:33,810
永远要瞄准头部  这是杀死他们的唯一方法
Always aim for the head. That's the only way to kill 'em.

115
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:35,640
能把这个关掉吗
Will you turn that off?

116
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:37,970
我在给班纳博士看入门视频而已
I was just showing Dr. Banner the orientation video.

117
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:41,950
我是朵拉护卫队的奥克耶将军  瓦坎达皇家护卫队
General Okoye of the Dora Milaje. Wakandan Royal Guard.

118
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,680
你真是选了个好时机
You certainly picked a hell of a time

119
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,080
来拜访我国  将军
to visit the States, General.

120
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:47,090
我发誓要效忠国家  班纳博士  
I swore an oath, Dr. Banner.

121
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:49,890
我的国王几星期前和复仇者们一起失踪了
My king went missing with the Avengers weeks ago.

122
00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:51,690
这是自从病毒爆发以来
And for the first time since the outbreak,

123
00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:53,940
我们第一次发现了一丝希望
we actually have a reason to hope.

124
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,400
我们刚刚收到了一个信号
A beacon just came in over the wires.

125
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:03,470
某个幸存者营地声称他们在研制解药方面取得了进展
Another survivor camp claims to have made progress on a cure.

126
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:06,810
太棒了  全球危机解除了  各位来击掌吧
Wh... Awesome! Global crisis solved. High-fives all around, guys.

127
00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:07,590
先别着急
Not quite.

128
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:09,810
信号的位置在传输过程中被损坏了
The beacon's location was corrupted in transit.

129
00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:11,090
我们不知道它是从哪里发送过来的
We have no idea where it came from.

130
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:14,260
看起来这条消息是非线性六进制码构成的
Well, it looks to me like your message is in non-linear hexacode.

131
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:16,170
这个位置看起来眼熟吗  卡特探员
That location look familiar, Agent Carter?

132
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:17,650
那是新泽西的利海营
It's Camp Lehigh in New Jersey.

133
00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:19,800
神盾局的第一个作战基地
S.H.I.E.L.D.'s first base of operations.

134
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,430
那里的确有相应可以生产解药的装备
It could have the equipment you need to fabricate a cure.

135
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:23,880
那我们天黑就出发
Then we'll leave at sundown.

136
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:26,910
你以为事情不会更糟了
Well, just when you thought things couldn't get any worse,

137
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:28,580
结果我们又得去新泽西了
we gotta go to Jersey.

138
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,980
哪怕到了僵尸末日  不知道为什么  我还是司机
Zombie-freakin'-apocalypse, and somehow, I'm still driving.

139
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:34,300
有什么问题吗  你本来不就是个优步司机吗
What is the problem? I thought you were an Uber driver.

140
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:37,760
不  我是个私人司机  两者是有区别的
No. I'm a personal chauffeur. There's a difference.

141
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:43,190
好了  各位  中央车站到了
All right, everybody, it's Grand Central.

142
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:47,830
霍普  班纳  帕克  去七号线
Hope, Banner, Parker, track seven.

143
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,180
想办法把火车启动起来
See if you can hot-wire the train.

144
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:51,540
听起来像是个犯罪行动  我来帮忙
Sounds like job for criminal. I will help.

145
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:52,560
分头行动吗
Uh, splitting up?

146
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:55,210
你们瓦坎达是不是没有恐怖片
Do you guys just not have horror movies in Wakanda?

147
00:08:55,210 --> 00:08:57,670
我们不需要  我们有美国真人秀就够了
We don't need them. We have American reality shows.

148
00:08:57,670 --> 00:09:00,650
炸药爆炸  将会灼伤我们大家
Boom goes the dynamite. That was solid burn on all of us.

149
00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:03,740
其余的人留在这里  守住外围
The rest of us will stay here and guard the perimeter.

150
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:06,560
没有电  我们这里没有电
No juice. We're getting no juice.

151
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,520
火车  求你为我启动吧
Train, please be working for Daddy.

152
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:10,510
没有动静
It's not working.

153
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:11,990
我们打不开变速箱
We're locked outta the gear box.

154
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:15,090
我来吧  我可以从内部启动引擎
I'm on it. I can jump-start the engine from the inside.

155
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,070
点火装置启动不起来
Spark ignition's not firing.

156
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:25,360
需要有个人去推一下
We need someone to give us a push.

157
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,060
也许你可以召唤一下内心的绿色恶魔
Perhaps you summon your inner green demon.

158
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:29,060
不  他休假呢  有别的办法吗
No. He's on sabbatical. Any other ideas?

159
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:31,650
除非有人刚好有个巨大的弹弓
Not unless someone happens to have a giant slingshot.

160
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:32,910
我有办法了
I've got an idea!

161
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:34,950
别忘了把刹车松开
Make sure the brake lock is engaged.

162
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:45,730
邦邦邦邦邦邦
Blam! Blam! Blam! Blam, blam! Blam!

163
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:49,120
是鸟而已
Just, uh, birds.

164
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,310
-你刚刚说的是 "邦" 吗  -我说了吗
- Were you saying "Blam"? - Was I?

165
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:55,930
哈皮
Happy?

166
00:09:57,710 --> 00:10:02,710
邦邦邦邦邦邦  邦
Blam, blam, blam, blam, blam! Blam! Blam!

167
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:04,000
哈皮
Happy!

168
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,570
有人受伤  有人受伤  哈皮不见了
Man down, man down. We lost Happy!

169
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:09,880
什么  不  不  不要是哈皮
What? No! No, not Happy.

170
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,060
我想那是
I think it was...

171
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:16,460
是鹰眼
It's Hawkeye.

172
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:25,010
邦邦邦
Blam. Blam. Blam.

173
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:34,550
邦
Blam.

174
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:56,990
邦
Bla...

175
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:58,270
抱歉  哈皮
Sorry, Happy.

176
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:02,390
邦
Blam.

177
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:16,010
那是你朋友  真抱歉
That was your friend. Sorry about that.

178
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:19,420
-我应该难过  但我并不难过  -走吧
- I should be sad, but I'm not. - Let's go.

179
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:31,670
好了  伙计们
Okay, come on, guys!

180
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:33,850
这推力大概有4000磅了
I think I have about 4,000 pounds of thrust here.

181
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:35,240
撑住  彼得  他们快冲进来了
Hang in there, Peter. They're almost here.

182
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:38,520
好  准备松开刹车  听我信号
Okay, get ready to disengage the brake on my mark.

183
00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:45,160
真棒  斗篷
Heck yeah, Cape!

184
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:48,040
不不不  坏僵尸  坏僵尸  坏僵尸
No! No, no, bad zombie! Bad zombie! Bad zombie!

185
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:54,750
你真是个了不起的女人
You are remarkable woman!

186
00:11:57,620 --> 00:11:59,440
火车前面都连好了
The front of the train's all hooked up!

187
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,340
收到  进站了
Copy that. Inbound.

188
00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:09,910
我们都上来了  走
We're all here! Go!

189
00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:25,730
我们做到了  目的地利海营
We did it. Destination, Camp Lehigh.

190
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:32,700
造型不错
It's a good look on you.

191
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:35,100
真的吗  你觉得我能撑得起吗
Really? You think I could pull it off?

192
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:36,770
也许你长大后就行了
Maybe you'll grow into it.

193
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,890
抱歉  我们应该待在一起的
I'm sorry. We should have stayed together.

194
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:08,570
莎伦  莎伦
Sharon? Sharon!

195
00:13:12,890 --> 00:13:14,650
我想你该咬够了  队长
I think you've had enough, Cap.

196
00:13:45,890 --> 00:13:46,870
巴基
Bucky!

197
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:02,410
抱歉  伙计  我想这就是你的终点了
Sorry, pal. I guess this is the end of the line.

198
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:13,120
伙计们  我浑身都是莎伦
Uh, guys, I'm covered in Sharon.

199
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:14,980
那小家伙带了洗手液
The kid has hand sanitizer.

200
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,760
霍普
Uh, Hope?

201
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:21,600
我想你有麻烦了
I think you're in trouble.

202
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:30,160
心率升高
Heart rate's elevated,

203
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:33,360
体温也在攀升
temperature's not going in the right direction.

204
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,660
那我们都知道你该怎么做了
Then we both know what you have to do.

205
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:38,010
不  我们马上就要拿到解药了
No. Not when we could be minutes away from a cure.

206
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:40,600
我们能冒那个险吗
Can we really take that risk?

207
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:43,370
这不是冒险  是希望
It's not risk. It's hope.

208
00:14:43,370 --> 00:14:45,000
任何看过僵尸电影的人
And anyone who's seen a zombie movie

209
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,010
都知道那是幸存的关键
knows that that's the key to survival.

210
00:14:47,010 --> 00:14:51,160
再说了那也是你的名字  一定意味着什么
Plus, it's also your name, and that's gotta mean something.

211
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:54,340
小子  你是怎么做到的
Oh, kid. How do you do it?

212
00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:57,030
看电影吗  电影俱乐部
See all these movies? AV club.

213
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:59,740
不  不是  你是如何如此
No. No, how do you stay so...

214
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:02,070
乐观的
...upbeat?

215
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,520
都发生这么多事了
After everything.

216
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,960
大概是久病成医吧
Practice, I guess.

217
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:11,730
我爸妈  本叔叔  斯塔克先生
My mom, dad, Uncle Ben, Mr. Stark.

218
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:13,520
现在哈皮也走了
Now Happy.

219
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:16,730
我  我失去了很多
I've... I've lost a lot.

220
00:15:18,070 --> 00:15:21,340
但我梅婶婶说  曾说过
But my Aunt May says...used to say,

221
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:24,320
如果我们不在他们再不能微笑时保持微笑
that if we don't keep smiling when they can't,

222
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:27,310
那我们还不如也随他们而去  还有
then we might as well just be gone, too. And...

223
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:31,520
他们会想让我们继续走下去的
Well, they'd want us to keep going.

224
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:39,920
伙计们  坏消息
Guys, uh, bad news, team.

225
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,440
火车没燃料了
The train has run out of fuel.

226
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,070
我们离利海营还有多远
How far away are we from Camp Lehigh?

227
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:46,370
好的方面是我们至少比之前离得要近了
On the bright side, we are at least closer than we were.

228
00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:47,610
不好的方面呢
And the not-bright side?

229
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:50,730
我们得穿过那块区域
We're going to have to walk through that.

230
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:59,950
看来我们全都得上了
Well, looks like our draft cards just got pulled.

231
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:01,610
我们穿不过去的
We will not make it through them.

232
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:04,220
但你们可以从上面过去
But you can make it over them.

233
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:05,830
不不  霍普  不
No, no. Hope, no.

234
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:09,500
听我说  我们都知道我要死了  好吗
Listen to me. We all know my time's up, okay?

235
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:11,120
如果我反正要死
And if I have to go,

236
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:13,730
不如去解决掉我引出的麻烦
I might as well go out fixing the mess I started.

237
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:16,760
拜托  霍普  这不是你的错
Oh, come on, Hope. It's not your fault.

238
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:19,400
我太执着于把我妈带回来
I was so obsessed with bringing my mom back

239
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:22,590
而从未考虑过什么会和她一起回来
that I never considered what I might bring back with her.

240
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:26,890
这一切由我而始  但你会终结这一切
I started this, but you are gonna finish it.

241
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:12,510
彼得
Peter.

242
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:18,570
微笑  为我微笑好吗
Smile. Smile for me, okay?

243
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:43,830
伙计们  他们为什么不爬围栏
Uh, guys, why aren't they climbing the fence?

244
00:17:51,010 --> 00:17:53,640
他们其实都不用爬铁网
Uh, they don't have to scale anything.

245
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:58,020
大家小心行事 芭芭雅嘎就在附近
We must be careful. Baba Yaga nears.

246
00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:00,480
-我能感觉到她  -芭芭什么
- I can feel her. - Baba who, now?

247
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,220
芭芭雅嘎  是巫婆
Baba Yaga. The witch.

248
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:06,960
传说在宗教坟陵中出没
Known to lurk in shadows of sacred burial grounds.

249
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:10,370
-芭芭雅  -不  我真是吓了你一跳
- Baba Ya... - Oh, no, I totally just jump-scared you.

250
00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:11,680
真抱歉  我不是有意吓你
Sorry. I didn't mean to do that.

251
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,680
蜘蛛小子  拜托
It's just spider boy. Come on.

252
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,010
芭芭雅
Baba Ya...

253
00:18:15,710 --> 00:18:17,470
幻视  你是幻视
Oh, Vision! You're a vision!

254
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:19,900
你无法想象我看到熟悉面孔有多高兴
You have no idea how good it is to see a familiar

255
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:22,060
我可看够那些恶心的  面目全非的脸了
and not one of those gross, half-eaten faces.

256
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:24,480
做机器人的好处之一
One of the benefits of being an android.

257
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,400
丧尸们对我不感冒
I'm not on the menu.

258
00:18:26,410 --> 00:18:27,610
原来是这样
Oh, that's it.

259
00:18:27,610 --> 00:18:30,490
所以你能把丧尸隔离在外
That's how you've been able to keep the zombies at bay.

260
00:18:30,670 --> 00:18:34,030
心灵宝石  源自于  我
The Mind Stone. The source of... well, me.

261
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:37,050
会释放一种他们不喜欢的次频率  
It emits a sub-frequency that is not to their liking.

262
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:40,590
这会不会意味着感染实际是一种大脑疾病
Could that mean the infection is some kind of encephalopathy?

263
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:42,260
-跟大脑有关  -没错
- Brain stuff. - Precisely.

264
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:44,680
病毒的侵入使大脑边缘系统超负荷
The virus overloads the brain's limbic system.

265
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:47,980
所以我发现被感染者对心灵宝石的反感后
So once I discovered the infecteds' aversion to the Mind Stone,

266
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:49,240
就进行了实验
I experimented to see if

267
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:52,070
看定向暴露会不会逆转他们的状况
targeted exposure might reverse their condition.

268
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:52,980
你成功了吗
Were you successful?

269
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:54,940
自己看吧
Ta-da! See for yourself.

270
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:56,420
-慢着  谁在说话  -难道是鬼魂
- Wait, who said that? - Was a ghost?

271
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:58,890
见鬼  谁能把我转过来
Oh, damn. Hey, would somebody turn me around?

272
00:18:58,890 --> 00:19:00,160
我的入场方式太尴尬了
We messed up my entrance.

273
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,490
我得让这椅子自动化
You know, I need to get this thing motorized.

274
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:04,420
斯科特
Scott!

275
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:06,280
-斯科特  -朗
- Scott. - Lang?

276
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:08,630
不会吧
No... way.

277
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:09,590
你怎么这样了
Oh, look at you.

278
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,160
我知道我轻了不少
I know I've lost weight.

279
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,380
谢谢你们的关心
Thank you for noticing.

280
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:14,460
不过别担心  我不会在意的
But don't worry, I won't let it go to my head.

281
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:17,920
抱歉  我想用冷笑话一笔带过我的血泪史
Sorry, I tend to process traumatic events with dad jokes.

282
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,250
总让汉克抓狂
Drives Hank crazy.

283
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:20,780
曾经让汉克抓狂
Well, drove Hank crazy.

284
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:22,390
可怜的汉克
Oh, man. Hank.

285
00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:26,700
图拉  图拉不要哭  罐子蒙雾的
Hey, tulla, tulla. Don't cry. You'll fog up your jar.

286
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:28,020
抱歉  我知道
Sorry. I know, I know.

287
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:30,380
只是  我再也没机会让那个老顽固
It's just, what I wouldn't give to get chewed out

288
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:31,970
说教一番[嚼碎]了
by that old grump one last time.

289
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:34,460
又一语双关了  丧尸梗
Gah, I did it again! Zombie pun.

290
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:36,610
关键在于我治好了他
Well, the operative point is I cured him.

291
00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:38,400
也就是说你也能救其他人
Which means you can cure others.

292
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,210
理论上可以  但
Theoretically, but...

293
00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:41,260
我们需要接入卫星网络
We'll need access to a satellite network

294
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:43,960
将心灵宝石的频率散播到全世界
to broadcast the Mind Stone frequency worldwide.

295
00:19:43,970 --> 00:19:45,570
话说回来  理论上可以
Well, again, theoretically,

296
00:19:45,570 --> 00:19:46,770
但目前人类
but the technology required

297
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:49,470
还未能研发出此类科技
to do so is currently beyond human capability.

298
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:51,910
瓦坎达可不一定  我们的能量屏障 
Not in Wakanda. And thanks to our force shields,

299
00:19:51,910 --> 00:19:55,170
让那里成为地球上人类最后的庇护所
it remains the last human sanctuary on Earth.

300
00:19:55,170 --> 00:19:57,720
我去搜寻一下基地  兴许能找到交通工具
I'll canvas the base, see if I can find us transport.

301
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:02,720
巴恩斯中士  你是找不到的
Sergeant Barnes, you will not find what you're looking for.

302
00:20:14,290 --> 00:20:17,070
按照这些安全日志所记录的内容
Uh, according to these security logs,

303
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:19,400
不止有我们回应了幻视的信号
we're not the first to respond to Vision's signal.

304
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:22,410
还有幸存者  那他们在哪
More survivors! Well, then where are they?

305
00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:37,370
停下  你会激怒她的
Stop. You will anger her.

306
00:20:37,930 --> 00:20:38,950
特查拉
T'Challa?

307
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,060
巴基
Bucky.

308
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:43,270
真是你吗
Is it really you?

309
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:44,590
谁对你下的手
Who did this to you?

310
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:48,380
时间所剩无几了  我们得赶快逃  马上
We don't have much time. We have to run. Now.

311
00:20:54,150 --> 00:20:55,910
很抱歉  班纳博士
I'm sorry, Dr. Banner.

312
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,240
我真希望你没有找到我们
I really do wish you hadn't found us.

313
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:00,320
幻视  这里到底是什么地方
Vision, what the hell is this place?

314
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:01,550
一个陷阱
A trap.

315
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:05,370
我们以为你已经死了
Oh, we feared you were dead!

316
00:21:05,370 --> 00:21:08,360
幻视在旧金山带走了我
The Vision grabbed me in San Francisco.

317
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:09,870
我还以为他在救我
Thought he was saving me.

318
00:21:09,870 --> 00:21:11,960
他只不过是出来取外卖
He was just picking up takeout.

319
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:14,890
他留着特查拉喂养他的丧尸新娘
He's been keeping him alive to feed his zombie bride.

320
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:16,560
那个哥特小妞  我就知道
That goth chick. I knew it! 

321
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:17,400
我就查觉到有些不对劲
I was pickin' up vibes.

322
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,390
她叫旺达
Her name is Wanda.

323
00:21:19,490 --> 00:21:21,580
你的愤怒可以理解
And while your anger is predictable,

324
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:23,900
我向你保证  我的行为虽然很可恨
I can assure you my actions, though unsavory,

325
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:26,310
但都是出于逻辑
were nevertheless born of logic.

326
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:29,210
帮幻视说一句...我无话可说
Well, in Vision's defense... I've got nothing.

327
00:21:29,210 --> 00:21:30,280
行吧  等等  我不明白
Okay, wait, I don't get it.

328
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:32,340
你救了碎嘴脑袋却没能救她
You cured the talking head but not her?

329
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:35,510
她的能力太强大  导致治疗无效
Her powers are too strong. They've resisted the treatment.

330
00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:39,270
唯一的办法只有束缚好她本人和她的饥饿
The only course of action is to contain her and her hunger.

331
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:40,970
为什么不除掉她
Why not eliminate her?

332
00:21:41,450 --> 00:21:45,250
我...我做不到
I...I couldn't.

333
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:48,680
你打着爱情的名号
You lured innocent people to their deaths,

334
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:50,830
引诱无辜的人前来送命
all in the name of love?

335
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:52,790
爱情  恶心
Love. Sucks.

336
00:21:52,790 --> 00:21:56,560
我到现在没完全弄清楚自己做了什么
I still cannot entirely fathom what I have done.

337
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:59,720
那么你应该对实现人类正义没什么意见了
So you should have no problem submitting to human justice!

338
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:03,890
你们唤醒了她
You have awakened her.

339
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:08,650
她已经好几天没进食
She hasn't eaten in days.

340
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:21,610
芭芭雅嘎
Baba Yaga!

341
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:24,040
{\an8}同时还有"男人杀手"之意  此处为双关

342
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:24,040
当心  她是食人者
Watch out! She's a man-eater!

343
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:26,070
看  我又玩双关梗
There it is, I'm doing it again.

344
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:37,950
谢谢  感觉像回到了毕业舞会
Ah, thanks. I feel like I'm back at prom.

345
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:43,380
幻视  我们需要你帮助  帮我们离开这
Vision, we need your help. Get us out of here.

346
00:22:48,490 --> 00:22:51,080
好的博士  我相信你说得对
Yes, Doctor, I believe you are right.

347
00:22:55,530 --> 00:22:57,620
漂浮咒
Wingardium leviosa!

348
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:00,900
奥克耶
Okoye.

349
00:23:02,870 --> 00:23:03,920
奥克耶
Okoye!

350
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:06,540
陛下  瓦坎达万岁
My king. Wakanda forever.

351
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,090
我们时间不多  机库里还有一架夸式战斗机
We haven't much time. There's a Quadjet in the hangar.

352
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:19,100
你不跟着来吗
You're not coming?

353
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:22,140
我要为自己的行为赎罪
I must atone for what I have done.

354
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:25,950
但我不能允许自己离开她
But I cannot bring myself to leave her.

355
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:58,760
巴基
Bucky!

356
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:00,950
快走
Run.

357
00:24:41,010 --> 00:24:43,350
救得漂亮  大块头
Oh, nice save, big guy.

358
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:48,070
你能驾驶它吗
Do you think you can fly this?

359
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:49,510
只要发动起来就能
Uh, if it ever boots up.

360
00:24:49,510 --> 00:24:51,920
各位  6点钟方向  我们的末日逼近了
Uh, guys, impending doom on our six.

361
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:54,350
是12点钟方向  但是的  脑袋说得对
Uh, that's our 12. But yes, what the head said

362
00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:54,780
末日  完全末日
Doom, total doom.

363
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:56,460
我能帮你们争取些时间
I can buy you guys some time...

364
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:58,270
班纳博士  我们不能丢下你
Dr. Banner, no, we are not leaving you.

365
00:24:58,270 --> 00:25:00,120
我就是...我...我真的
I just... I... I really,

366
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:02,440
今天我不能再失去一位朋友了
I don't think I can lose another friend today.

367
00:25:03,150 --> 00:25:05,800
那就...为我们复仇
So... avenge us.

368
00:25:07,950 --> 00:25:08,950
好
Yeah.

369
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:16,210
好了  大块头  靠你了
Okay, big guy. Kinda counting on you here.

370
00:25:16,690 --> 00:25:19,970
情况很不妙  如果你能出来当英雄就最好
Things are pretty bad. It'd be nice for you to be the hero.

371
00:25:20,610 --> 00:25:23,300
如果能转而做一次好人
I mean, wouldn't it be kinda cool for you

372
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:26,440
不是很酷吗
to be the nice one for a change?

373
00:25:28,590 --> 00:25:30,460
太好了
Oh, yes!

374
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:32,980
不  不  不  不
Oh, no, no, no, no.

375
00:25:57,610 --> 00:25:58,860
我们做到了  我们真的做到了
We did it! We really did it!

376
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:02,590
别  不要乌鸦嘴  这就没人看过恐怖片吗
No, don't jinx it! Doesn't anybody here watch horror movies?

377
00:26:05,490 --> 00:26:07,000
霍普  霍普
Hope? Hope!

378
00:26:08,690 --> 00:26:09,730
霍普
Hope!

379
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:13,800
点燃推进器
Firing thrusters.

380
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:27,390
对不起
I'm sorry.

381
00:26:28,230 --> 00:26:30,550
她舍弃自己的性命  我们才能去找解药
She gave her life so we could get the cure.

382
00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:33,560
这是她第二次救我
That's twice she saved me.

383
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:37,190
那...非常霍普
That's... very Hope.

384
00:26:48,990 --> 00:26:51,240
预计20分钟到达目的地
ETA, 20 minutes.

385
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:54,470
给复仇者们再记上一场胜利
Well, put another "W" On the board for the Avengers.

386
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:58,530
来吧  击个掌  没关系  我不会觉得被冷落
Go ahead, high-five. It's okay, I won't feel left out.

387
00:26:59,090 --> 00:27:00,420
你没事吧
You all right?

388
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:04,240
去年斯塔克先生让我加入复仇者
Last year, Mr. Stark asked me to join the Avengers.

389
00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:07,260
我拒绝了  现在他们都不在了
I turned him down, and now they're all gone.

390
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:08,720
可我还在
And I'm still here.

391
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:12,560
在我的文化里  死亡不是终点
In my culture, death is not the end.

392
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:17,170
只要我们铭记他们  他们就和我们在一起
They are still with us, as long as we do not forget them.

393
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:19,050
此外  不是所有人都走了
Plus, they're not all gone.

394
00:27:20,010 --> 00:27:21,920
我  你还有我
Me. You still have me.

395
00:27:22,430 --> 00:27:25,180
我很抱...我  我忘了  你也是复仇者
I'm so sor... I-I forgot. You are an Avenger.

396
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:26,540
那当然  重要成员
Totally. Big time.

397
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:29,180
虽然可能没官宣  但心里肯定是
Well, maybe not officially. But, you know, at heart.

398
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:32,140
好  世界现在需要一些真心
Good. The world could use a little heart right now.

399
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:36,040
一旦我们把这个带去瓦坎达  就能拯救世界
And once we get this to Wakanda, we're gonna save the world.

400
00:27:37,310 --> 00:27:38,880
即使在至暗时刻
Even in the darkest of times,

401
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:42,060
人类还会竭尽所能去拯救他们的星球
humans will give all to save their planet.

402
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:48,440
哪怕会带来世界的终结
Even if it might bring an end to the universe.
